# Ewaste
E-waste (electronic waste) refers to discarded electrical or electronic devices at the end of their useful life, including everything from smartphones, computers, and TVs to refrigerators and toys, encompassing items with a plug or battery. 
Any item with a plug or battery that's no longer wanted, from large appliances (fridges, TVs) to small gadgets (phones, printers, cables). 
Also called WEEE (Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment) or e-scrap. 
Why it's a problem
Health Hazards: Contains heavy metals (lead, mercury, cadmium) and flame retardants that can cause neurological damage, kidney failure, and other illnesses, especially in children. 
Environmental Pollution: Toxic materials can leach into soil, water, and air, disrupting ecosystems. 
Rapid Growth: Driven by short lifespans, frequent upgrades, and increasing consumption, it's a huge and growing volume of waste. 
Low Recycling Rates: Most e-waste ends up in landfills or informal, unsafe recycling operations, especially in developing countries. 
What's inside (Valuable & Toxic)
Valuable: Gold, silver, copper, rare earths.
Toxic: Lead, mercury, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, beryllium, brominated flame retardants. 
Solutions
Reduce: Buy less, choose longer-lasting products. 
Reuse/Repair: Extend product life through refurbishment and repair. 
Recycle Properly: Use certified e-waste recyclers for safe dismantling, hazardous material separation, and resource recovery. 
Policy & Awareness: Implement better collection, regulations (like WEEE directives), and public education.

Electronic waste (or e-waste) describes discarded electrical or electronic devices. It is also commonly known as waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) or end-of-life (EOL) electronics.[1][2][3] Used electronics which are destined for refurbishment, reuse, resale, salvage recycling through material recovery, or disposal are also considered e-waste. Informal processing of e-waste in developing countries can lead to adverse human health effects and environmental pollution.[4] The growing consumption of electronic goods due to the Digital Revolution and innovations in science and technology, such as bitcoin, has led to a global e-waste problem and hazard. The rapid exponential increase of e-waste is due to frequent new model releases and unnecessary purchases of electrical and electronic equipment (EEE), short innovation cycles and low recycling rates, and a drop in the average life span of computers.[5
May 2020, a scientific study was conducted in China that investigated the occurrence and distribution of traditional and novel classes of contaminants, including chlorinated, brominated, and mixed halogenated dibenzo-p-dioxins/dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs, PBDD/Fs, PXDD/Fs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polyhalogenated carbazoles (PHCZs) in soil from an e-waste disposal site in Hangzhou (which has been in operation since 2009 and has a treatment capacity of 19.6 Wt/a). While the study area has only one formal emission source, the broader industrial zone has a number of metal recovery and reprocessing plants as well as heavy traffic on adjacent motorways where normal and heavy-duty devices are used. The maximum concentrations of the target halogenated organic compounds HOCs were 0.1–1.5 km away from the main source and overall detected levels of HOCs were generally lower than those reported globally. The study proved what researchers have warned, i. e. on highways with heavy traffic, especially those serving diesel powered vehicles, exhaust emissions are larger sources of dioxins than stationary sources. When assessing the environmental and health impacts of chemical compounds, especially PBDD/Fs and PXDD/Fs, the compositional complexity of soil and long period weather conditions like rain and downwind have to be taken into account. Further investigations are necessary to build up a common understanding and methods for assessing e-waste impacts.[1][181
